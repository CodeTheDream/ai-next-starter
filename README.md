# Next.js OpenAI Starter App

This is a starter kit for integrating [OpenAI's API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) into a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application. It is crafted with minimal styling and basic API integration so you can strip it and bring your own libraries to make it your own. Feel free to fork and create something amazing!

## Getting Started

First, fork the repo to your dev environment and install the packages:

```bash
npm i
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Important!

Make sure that update the `OPENAI_API_KEY=yourApiKey` in the `.env` file.
